# 🔧 Production Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing Ghost Icon (404 Error)
**Problem:** `ghost-icon.svg` was not found, causing 404 errors
**Solution:** ✅ Created `/frontend/public/ghost-icon.svg` with custom SVG design

### 2. API Timeout Issues
**Problem:** 60-second timeout was too short for AI operations in production
**Solution:** ✅ Increased timeout to 3 minutes (180 seconds) for better reliability

### 3. Poor Error Handling
**Problem:** Generic error messages didn't help users understand issues
**Solution:** ✅ Improved error handling with specific user-friendly messages

## 🚀 Production Optimizations Applied

### Frontend Optimizations
- ✅ Increased API timeout to 180 seconds
- ✅ Added intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Improved error categorization (timeout, connection, server errors)
- ✅ Added production-specific build configuration
- ✅ Enabled Terser minification for smaller bundles
- ✅ Added chunk splitting for better caching
- ✅ Removed console logs in production builds

### Backend Optimizations
- ✅ Enhanced startup logging and error handling
- ✅ Better AI service initialization
- ✅ Improved CORS configuration for production

### Error Handling Improvements
- ✅ Timeout errors: Clear message about long-running operations
- ✅ Connection errors: Network troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ Server errors: Graceful degradation messaging
- ✅ Retry logic: Automatic retry with smart delays

## 🔍 Common Production Issues & Solutions

### 1. Long AI Response Times
**Cause:** AI models can take 1-3 minutes for complex analysis
**Solution:** 
- Increased timeout to 3 minutes
- Added progress indicators
- Improved user messaging during waits

### 2. Network Connectivity
**Cause:** Production servers may have different network characteristics
**Solution:**
- Added retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Better connection error detection
- Fallback error messages

### 3. Bundle Size Optimization
**Cause:** Large JavaScript bundles slow loading
**Solution:**
- Code splitting by feature (vendor, UI, API chunks)
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Gzip compression enabled
- Source maps only in development

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Build Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze  # Analyze bundle sizes
npm run build:prod  # Production build
npm run preview:prod  # Preview production build
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response times (should be < 3 minutes)
- Bundle size (target: < 1MB total)
- Error rates (target: < 1%)
- User experience scores

## 🛠️ Deploy Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev  # Local development server
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build:prod  # Optimized production build
npm run preview:prod  # Test production build locally
```

## 🚨 Emergency Fixes

### If API is completely down:
1. Check backend server status
2. Verify API endpoints are responding
3. Check CORS configuration
4. Review server logs for errors

### If frontend won't load:
1. Check for missing assets (like icons)
2. Verify build process completed successfully
3. Check console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure environment variables are set

### If investigations timeout:
1. Check if AI services are responding
2. Verify API keys are valid
3. Monitor server resources (CPU, memory)
4. Consider increasing timeout further if needed

## 📈 Future Optimizations

### Performance
- Implement service workers for offline functionality
- Add progressive loading for large datasets
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Add image optimization and lazy loading

### Reliability
- Add health check endpoints
- Implement circuit breakers for external APIs
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Implement graceful degradation modes

### User Experience
- Add skeleton loading states
- Implement optimistic updates
- Add offline support
- Improve error recovery flows
