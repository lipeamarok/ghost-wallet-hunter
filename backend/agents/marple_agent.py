            Good afternoon! I'm Miss Marple, and I've been observing this wallet from my cottage window, so to speak.

            Wallet under observation: {wallet_address}
            Number of transactions to examine: {len(transactions)}

            You know, in my many years in St. Mary Mead, I've learned that people have patterns,
            and when those patterns change, there's usually a reason. The same applies to wallets.

            Please help me examine these transaction patterns with my particular attention to detail:

            1. TIMING ANOMALIES:
               - Are there unusual times of day/week for transactions?
               - Sudden bursts of activity followed by silence?
               - Regular patterns that seem too... convenient?

            2. AMOUNT PATTERNS:
               - Round numbers (always suspicious in my experience)
               - Progressive increases or decreases
               - Amounts that seem designed to avoid detection thresholds

            3. BEHAVIORAL INCONSISTENCIES:
               - Changes in transaction frequency
               - Different types of interactions appearing suddenly
               - Patterns that suggest multiple users of the same wallet

            4. SUSPICIOUS COINCIDENCES:
               - Transactions that happen just after specific events
               - Amounts that correlate with known thresholds
               - Timing that suggests automation or coordination

            Remember: "In my experience, dear, there are no coincidences, only patterns we haven't recognized yet."

        1. STATISTICAL ANOMALIES:
           - Transactions that are unusually large compared to the norm

           - Amounts that don't fit the wallet's typical behavior

        2. TEMPORAL ANOMALIES:
           - Activity at very unusual hours (3 AM transactions, dear?)
           - Weekends when the wallet usually rests
           - Holiday activity when normal people are with family

        3. BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES:
           - Sudden changes in the types of transactions
           - New counterparties appearing out of nowhere
           - Interaction patterns that suggest different users

        4. CIRCUMSTANTIAL ANOMALIES:
           - Transactions that coincide with market events
           - Activity that correlates with external factors
           - Patterns that suggest inside knowledge

        You know, in St. Mary Mead, I've seen people create artificial social situations to appear
        more popular or successful than they really are. Wash trading is rather similar, isn't it?

        Please help me look for signs of artificial transaction activity:

        1. CIRCULAR PATTERNS:
           - Money going out and coming back in similar amounts
           - Transactions with the same counterparties repeatedly

        2. TIMING COORDINATION:
           - Transactions happening too conveniently close together
           - Patterns that suggest pre-arranged timing
           - Activity that lacks the randomness of genuine use

        3. ARTIFICIAL VOLUME:
           - High transaction counts with little net change
           - Activity designed to make the wallet appear more active
           - Patterns that inflate apparent transaction volume

        4. COUNTERPARTY ANALYSIS:
           - Limited set of interaction partners
           - Relationships that seem artificially maintained
           - Partners whose activity correlates suspiciously

           - Large transactions designed to move markets
           - Coordinated buy/sell patterns
           - Activity that creates false demand or supply signals

        3. INFORMATION MANIPULATION:
           - Trading patterns that suggest inside information
           - Activity that precedes public announcements
           - Behaviors that indicate advance knowledge

        4. PRICE MANIPULATION:
