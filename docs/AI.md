# Ghost Wallet Hunter - AI Implementation Guide

## 1. Purpose of AI in Ghost Wallet Hunter

AI is the core intelligence of the application. It is responsible for:

* Analyzing public on-chain data from the Solana blockchain, focusing on wallet connections
* Interpreting these connections to detect suspicious patterns (fraud, money laundering, manipulation)
* Generating simple, empathetic, educational explanations for both novice and professional users
* Minimizing false positives with clear instructions and layered analysis
* Coordinating with multiple agents (swarm) for enhanced quality and scalability

---

## 2. Detailed AI Features

### 2.1 On-Chain Data Analysis

* Connects via Solana RPC and auxiliary APIs to gather transaction data
* Extracts relevant info:

  * Recent transactions (e.g., last 10)
  * Wallets directly connected by transactions
  * Volume, frequency, timing, and interaction patterns
* Flags suspicious signs:

  * Simultaneous or unusual transaction patterns
  * Interaction with known malicious wallets (based on public lists or detected behavior)
* Builds simple “clusters” representing connected wallets

### 2.2 Textual Explanation Generation

* Converts analysis results into prompts for LLM (GPT-3.5 Turbo)
* Produces educational, non-alarmist explanations
* Adds automatic disclaimers to stress probabilistic nature
* Adjusts tone based on user profile (simplified vs. technical view)

#### Example Output

> “This wallet made 5 transactions to 2 others within 12 hours. While not definitive proof of fraud, such patterns may warrant caution. *This is an automated analysis based on known behaviors. For manual review, consult a specialist.*”

### 2.3 False Positive Reduction

* Rule-based filtering for trivial cases (e.g., official exchanges, recognized bots)
* Agent-level validation across sources before labeling suspicious
* Planned user feedback loop for ongoing refinement (post-MVP)

### 2.4 JuliaOS Agent Swarm Orchestration

* Assign specific agents:

  * Agent 1: on-chain data fetching
  * Agent 2: cluster/statistics analysis
  * Agent 3: explanation generation via LLM
* Agents collaborate to refine results
* Managed via JuliaOS CLI and APIs

---

## 3. AI Architecture in Code

### 3.1 Core Modules

* `solana_data_fetcher.py`: connects to RPC, fetches transactions
* `cluster_analyzer.py`: detects suspicious clusters
* `explanation_generator.py`: builds prompts and interacts with OpenAI API
* `agents_manager.py`: manages JuliaOS agent orchestration

### 3.2 Data Flow

```plaintext
User → FastAPI → agents_manager → solana_data_fetcher → cluster_analyzer → explanation_generator → FastAPI → User
```

### 3.3 Simplified Agent Structure

```python
class DataFetcherAgent(AgentBase):
    def run(self, wallet_address):
        # Fetch transactions from Solana RPC
        pass

class ClusterAnalyzerAgent(AgentBase):
    def run(self, transactions_data):
        # Detect suspicious clusters
        pass

class ExplanationAgent(AgentBase):
    def run(self, cluster_info):
        # Generate explanatory text via OpenAI
        pass
```

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 OpenAI Interaction

* Uses official OpenAI Python SDK
* Prompts crafted for neutral, educational, empathetic tone

  ```text
  Analyze the following clusters: {cluster_data}. Provide an educational, neutral explanation with highlighted risks. Include a disclaimer.
  ```

* Token limits enforced to reduce cost
* Fallbacks for API errors with default safe responses

### 4.2 JuliaOS Configuration

* Install via pip/npm
* Configure agents to run in swarm mode
* Define synchronous/asynchronous agent communication
* Log events for auditing and debugging

### 4.3 Config Parameters

* Max transactions per wallet (e.g., 10–20)
* Risk scoring rules (e.g., >3 simultaneous tx, >5 repeated links)
* Explanation detail level (prompt option)
* API rate limits and caching controls

## 5. AI Testing Plan

* Validate data collection from typical and flagged wallets
* Confirm accurate cluster detection logic
* Evaluate coherence and quality of LLM outputs
* Ensure graceful handling of low/no-data scenarios
* Test input edge cases for robustness

---

## 6. Documentation & Maintenance

* Document each agent, module, and flow in code and README
* Include usage examples and test scenarios
* Implement detailed logging for post-deploy analysis
* Establish prompt review and update routine

---

## 7. Ethical & Legal Considerations

* AI responses include automatic disclaimers
* Only public blockchain data used
* Language is empathetic and non-accusatory
* Human review mechanism planned (post-MVP)

## 8. AI Performance Metrics

* Perplexity Score: target < 20
* Cluster accuracy: target > 85%
* Average token usage per response: < 100

## Post-MVP AI Refinement Roadmap

* **Weeks 1–2:** Collect real user feedback, refine prompts and clustering rules
* **Weeks 3–4:** Integrate additional public datasets to enhance false positive filtering
* **Months 2–3:** A/B test different AI versions for tone and accuracy
* **Ongoing:** Monthly updates based on fraud trends and community input
