# ComplianceAnalysisAgent

## Overview

**ComplianceAnalysisAgent** is a specialized, real AI-powered agent for regulatory compliance and AML analysis. It autonomously performs AML screening, sanctions checks, regulatory risk assessment, compliance scoring, and generates structured compliance reports using OpenAI/Grok.

## Responsibilities

- Autonomous AML screening and red flag detection
- Sanctions screening against global lists (OFAC, EU, UN, etc.)
- Regulatory risk assessment (Travel Rule, KYC, DeFi, tax, etc.)
- Compliance scoring and risk categorization
- Generation of comprehensive compliance reports

## How it works

- Initializes by testing AI service connectivity
- Performs AML screening for suspicious patterns and risk level
- Conducts sanctions screening for direct/indirect hits and jurisdictional risks
- Assesses regulatory compliance (Travel Rule, KYC, MiCA, FinCEN, etc.)
- Calculates overall compliance score and risk category
- Generates a structured compliance report with findings, risk, and recommendations

## Strengths

- Fully autonomous, real AI-driven compliance analysis
- Covers AML, sanctions, and regulatory requirements
- Provides structured, actionable compliance reports
- Integrates with JuliaOS agent.useLLM() for future extensibility

## Weaknesses / Gaps

- Relies on AI and data quality for accuracy
- May overlap with DupinAgent in compliance/AML logic (refactor shared logic?)
- Does not perform deep behavioral or network analysis (focuses on compliance)

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Refactor shared compliance/AML logic to a utility module
- Enhance integration with other agents for richer context
- Add more automated detection of new/emerging regulations and sanctions

## Example Usage

```python
from agents.compliance_agent import ComplianceAnalysisAgent
agent = ComplianceAnalysisAgent()
await agent.initialize()
report = await agent.analyze_compliance_autonomous('wallet_address_here')
```
