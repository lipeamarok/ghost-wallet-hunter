# MarloweAgent (Philip Marlowe)

## Overview

**MarloweAgent** is inspired by Philip Marlowe, the classic private eye who specializes in tracking funds through the digital underground. In Ghost Wallet Hunter, MarloweAgent focuses on following money trails across bridges, mixers, and obfuscation protocols to uncover laundering and evasion tactics.

## Responsibilities

- Bridge transaction tracking (cross-chain fund tracing)
- Mixer and tumbler detection (privacy protocol analysis)
- Obfuscation network mapping (multi-wallet, multi-hop)
- Cross-chain behavioral analysis
- Compiling comprehensive tracking and evidence reports

## How it works

- Initializes by testing AI service connectivity
- Tracks bridge activity for cross-chain movement and evasion
- Detects mixer usage and analyzes laundering patterns
- Maps obfuscation networks and coordination between wallets
- Analyzes cross-chain behavior for regulatory or technical arbitrage
- Compiles all findings into a detailed tracking report with evidence and verdict

## Strengths

- Excels at following complex money trails and obfuscation
- Identifies both technical and behavioral laundering patterns
- Provides actionable, evidence-focused reports
- Maintains a database of known bridges and mixers

## Weaknesses / Gaps

- Relies on AI and transaction data for accuracy
- May overlap with other agents in pattern/behavioral analysis (refactor shared logic?)
- Does not directly classify risk/threat (focuses on tracking, not assessment)

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Refactor shared bridge/mixer/obfuscation logic to a utility module
- Enhance cross-agent evidence sharing and context
- Add more automated detection of new/unknown protocols

## Example Usage

```python
from agents.marlowe_agent import MarloweAgent
marlowe = MarloweAgent()
await marlowe.initialize()
result = await marlowe.track_bridge_activity('wallet_address_here', transactions)
```
