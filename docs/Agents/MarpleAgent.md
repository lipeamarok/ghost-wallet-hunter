# MarpleAgent (Miss Jane Marple)

## Overview

**MarpleAgent** is inspired by Miss Jane Marple, the classic detective known for her keen observation and ability to spot subtle patterns and anomalies. In Ghost Wallet Hunter, MarpleAgent specializes in detecting suspicious transaction patterns, behavioral inconsistencies, and statistical anomalies on the blockchain.

## Responsibilities

- Pattern and anomaly detection in wallet transactions
- Identification of suspicious behavioral changes
- Detection of wash trading and artificial activity
- Market manipulation analysis
- Compiling comprehensive reports on findings

## How it works

- Initializes by testing AI service connectivity
- Observes transaction patterns for timing, amount, and behavioral anomalies
- Detects statistical, temporal, behavioral, and circumstantial anomalies
- Identifies wash trading and artificial volume
- Spots market manipulation patterns (timing, volume, information, price)
- Compiles all findings into a detailed report with risk evaluation and recommendations

## Strengths

- Excels at finding subtle, non-obvious patterns
- Uses AI for deep pattern and anomaly analysis
- Provides narrative, human-like explanations
- Tracks and logs all findings for transparency

## Weaknesses / Gaps

- May overlap with PoirotAgent in behavioral/pattern analysis (refactor shared logic?)
- Relies on AI quality and transaction data completeness
- Does not directly classify threats or take action (focuses on observation)

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Refactor shared pattern/anomaly logic with PoirotAgent to a utility module
- Enhance integration with other agents for richer context
- Add more actionable threat classification or escalation logic

## Example Usage

```python
from agents.marple_agent import MarpleAgent
marple = MarpleAgent()
await marple.initialize()
result = await marple.observe_patterns('wallet_address_here', transactions)
```
