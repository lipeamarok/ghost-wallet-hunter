# RavenAgent (Raven)

## Overview

**RavenAgent** is inspired by the mystical communicator Raven, specializing in translating complex findings into clear, actionable explanations. In Ghost Wallet Hunter, RavenAgent synthesizes all detective insights into coherent, human-readable narratives for different audiences.

## Responsibilities

- Synthesis of all detective findings and reports
- Generation of clear, audience-specific explanations
- Construction of investigation narratives and timelines
- Translation of technical findings into accessible language
- Compiling final truth and guidance reports

## How it works

- Initializes by testing AI service connectivity
- Synthesizes findings from all agents into a unified narrative
- Generates explanations tailored to executive, technical, compliance, and other audiences
- Creates investigation narratives and evidence chains
- Translates technical findings for non-technical stakeholders
- Compiles all communications into a final truth report with guidance and recommendations

## Strengths

- Excels at making complex analysis understandable
- Supports multiple communication styles and frameworks
- Provides actionable, audience-specific insights
- Tracks and logs all synthesis and explanation activities

## Weaknesses / Gaps

- Relies on quality of detective findings and synthesis context
- May overlap with frontend explanation logic (refactor shared logic?)
- Does not perform direct analysis (focuses on communication, not detection)

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Refactor shared explanation/synthesis logic to a utility module
- Enhance integration with frontend and reporting systems
- Add more automated audience detection and style adaptation

## Example Usage

```python
from agents.raven_agent import RavenAgent
raven = RavenAgent()
await raven.initialize()
result = await raven.synthesize_detective_findings(all_detective_reports, analysis_context)
```
