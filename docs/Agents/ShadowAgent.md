# ShadowAgent (The Shadow)

## Overview

**ShadowAgent** is inspired by The Shadow, the mysterious crimefighter who specializes in network and cluster analysis. In Ghost Wallet Hunter, ShadowAgent maps hidden relationships, detects criminal clusters, and exposes the web of connections between suspicious wallets.

## Responsibilities

- Network topology analysis and mapping
- Criminal cluster identification and risk-based grouping
- Hidden relationship and indirect connection analysis
- Detection of coordination and communication patterns
- Compiling comprehensive network intelligence reports

## How it works

- Initializes by testing AI service connectivity
- Maps wallet networks and analyzes topology, centrality, and clusters
- Identifies criminal clusters using behavioral, temporal, geographic, and functional analysis
- Analyzes hidden relationships and indirect connections
- Detects coordination patterns across multiple wallets and time series
- Compiles all findings into a detailed network intelligence report with threat and recommendations

## Strengths

- Excels at uncovering hidden relationships and criminal clusters
- Uses advanced clustering and network analysis algorithms
- Provides actionable network intelligence and disruption points
- Tracks and logs all network mapping and cluster findings

## Weaknesses / Gaps

- Relies on AI and network data for accuracy
- May overlap with MarloweAgent in obfuscation/network mapping (refactor shared logic?)
- Does not directly classify risk/threat (focuses on network, not risk assessment)

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Refactor shared network/cluster logic to a utility module
- Enhance cross-agent evidence/context sharing
- Add more automated detection of new/unknown network patterns

## Example Usage

```python
from agents.shadow_agent import ShadowAgent
shadow = ShadowAgent()
await shadow.initialize()
result = await shadow.map_wallet_network('wallet_address_here', connected_wallets)
```
