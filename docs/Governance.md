## 3. Decision-Making Process

* **Change Proposals (RFCs):**

  * Structural changes must start with a `Proposal` issue using a detailed template (e.g., impact, risks, suggested solution).
  * Open public discussion for 5–7 days, followed by a maintainer vote.

* **Pull Requests:**

  * PRs ≤ 50 lines: review by 1 maintainer.
  * PRs > 50 lines: require review by 2 maintainers and approval from the technical lead.
  * PRs with documentation and automated tests receive priority.
