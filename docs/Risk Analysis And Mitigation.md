# Ghost Wallet Hunter - Risk Analysis and Mitigation

## Overview

This document outlines potential risks in the development, operation, and adoption of Ghost Wallet Hunter, categorized by type. Each risk includes its likelihood (Low/Medium/High), impact, and mitigation strategies, following guidelines such as the Solana Foundation's on-chain AI recommendations and IEEE's ethical principles.

## Risk Categories

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JuliaOS integration failures (bugs) | Medium | High | Daily unit tests; fallback to simple agents; monitor JuliaOS GitHub issues. |
| Solana RPC overload (rate limits) | High | Medium | Use priority fees; cache results in PostgreSQL; limit query volume. |
| AI accuracy (false positives) | High | High | Implement filters and rules; fine-tune with public datasets; clear disclaimers. |

### Ethical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI bias (flagging innocent users) | Medium | High | Regular audits (e.g., AIF360); neutral prompting; user feedback loops. |
| Emotional manipulation via AI explanations | Low | Medium | Use neutral/educational language; group testing; follow Montreal Declaration. |
| Privacy violations (on-chain data misuse) | Low | High | Use only public data; anonymize outputs; implied consent via UX design. |

### Legal and Regulatory Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Non-compliance with laws (GDPR, SEC, etc.) | Medium | High | Legal counsel; explainable AI (e.g., SHAP); avoid direct accusations. |
| Adversarial attacks (manipulated inputs) | Medium | Medium | Input validation; rate limiting; maintain detailed logs. |

### Market and Adoption Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low initial adoption | High | Medium | Community-focused marketing; incentivized beta program. |
| Competition (e.g., Chainalysis) | Medium | High | Emphasize decentralization and user empathy; open-source approach. |
| Operational costs | Low | Low | Token usage limits; migrate to open-source LLMs. |

## Risk Management Framework

### Audit and Monitoring Procedures

* **Technical Audits:** Quarterly audits using tools like Snyk (dependency security) and SonarQube (code quality).
* **Ethical Audits:** Biannual ethical audits based on the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, with a focus on bias, transparency, and social impact.
* **Audit Transparency:** All audit reports will be published publicly under `docs/audits` for open access.

### Continuous Monitoring

* **Monitoring Tools:** Sentry (error tracking), Google Analytics (usage monitoring), and ethical surveys.
* **Review Cycle:** Integrated quarterly reviews aligned with the project roadmap.
* **Contingency Plan:** Manual fallback if AI accuracy drops below 80%.

## Critical Risk Response Plan

### Top 3 Immediate Critical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Emergency Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI analysis endpoint failure | MVP halted | Deploy offline/manual fallback; issue public notice. |
| Solana RPC rate-limit/block | Service down | Auto-switch to testnet or secondary RPC provider. |
| API key leak (OpenAI) | Severe exposure | Immediate key rotation and log audit. |

### Emergency Response Protocols

1. **Immediate Response:** Issue identification and containment within 1 hour
2. **Communication:** Public status update within 4 hours of critical incidents
3. **Resolution:** Target resolution within 24 hours for critical issues
4. **Post-Incident:** Comprehensive post-mortem and prevention measures within 72 hours
