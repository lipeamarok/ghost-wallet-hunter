# Ghost Wallet Hunter – Security & Privacy | Risk Analysis and Mitigation

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Overview

This document outlines the principal risks in developing, operating, and scaling Ghost Wallet Hunter. Each risk is classified by type, with estimated likelihood, impact, and a clear mitigation strategy. The approach aligns with ethical, legal, and technical guidelines from the Web3, Solana, and AI communities.

### 1. Technical Risks

| Risk                              | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JuliaOS integration failures      | Medium     | High   | Daily unit tests; fallback logic to basic agents; monitor JuliaOS releases.                 |
| Solana RPC overload / rate limits | High       | Medium | Priority fee usage; caching results; query throttling; alternate RPC providers.             |
| AI false positives (accuracy)     | High       | High   | Rule-based filters, model tuning with open datasets, clear user disclaimers, manual audits. |
| API key leaks (OpenAI, RPC)       | Low        | High   | Secure secret management, automated key rotation, audit logs.                               |

### 2. Ethical Risks

| Risk                                           | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI bias (flagging innocent wallets)            | Medium     | High   | Periodic audits, neutral prompting, user feedback integration.    |
| Emotional manipulation (alarmist explanations) | Low        | Medium | Educational, neutral language; review via user group testing.     |
| Privacy violations                             | Low        | High   | Only public data processed; anonymize logs; clear UX disclaimers. |

### 3. Legal and Regulatory Risks

| Risk                                   | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-compliance (GDPR, SEC, etc.)       | Medium     | High   | Legal review, explainable AI, avoid direct accusations.   |
| Adversarial attacks (malicious inputs) | Medium     | Medium | Input validation, rate limiting, detailed error tracking. |

### 4. Market and Adoption Risks

| Risk                                   | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low adoption                           | High       | Medium | Community-focused marketing, incentivized beta, user education. |
| Strong competition (e.g., Chainalysis) | Medium     | High   | Focus on open-source, empathy, UX, and community.               |
| Operational costs                      | Low        | Medium | Usage caps, switch to open-source LLMs as needed.               |

### 5. Audit & Monitoring Framework

* **Technical audits:** Quarterly security/code quality checks with tools like Snyk, SonarQube.
* **Ethical audits:** Biannual reviews for bias/transparency (Montreal Declaration, IEEE standards).
* **Transparency:** Public reports published under `docs/audits`.

#### Continuous Monitoring

* **Tools:** Sentry (error tracking), Google Analytics, user feedback forms.
* **Review cycle:** Quarterly roadmap review; prompt audit if AI accuracy drops below 80%.
* **Contingency:** Manual fallback to non-AI logic if core endpoints fail.

### 6. Critical Risk Response

| Immediate Risk      | Impact         | Emergency Action                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| AI analysis failure | Service halted | Offline/manual fallback; public status notice.     |
| Solana RPC block    | Service down   | Auto-switch RPC or use testnet provider.           |
| API key leak        | Severe         | Immediate rotation, audit logs, user notification. |

* **Protocol:** Respond within 1 hour, update users within 4 hours, resolve within 24 hours, post-mortem in 72 hours.

## Security & Privacy

### Core Principles

-Only public on-chain data is analyzed—never private user data.
-No personal data is stored or collected.
-Stateless: backend only keeps anonymized logs for metrics/debugging.

### Technical Security

-HTTPS enforced for all communications.
-Production/testing environments are fully isolated.
-Backend only accesses required APIs.

### Privacy

-Analysis strictly at wallet-address level.
-Usage analytics are anonymized/aggregated.
-Clear privacy notice on the interface.

### AI/Data Security

-Secrets (OpenAI keys, etc) kept in secure environments.
-Prompts/audits prevent data leaks or bias.
-Rate-limiting stops abuse.

### Ethics

-Automatic disclaimers on all AI outputs.
-Educational/neutral language only.
-No accusations or judgments.

### Incident Response

-Public status page and rapid-response channels.
-Critical incidents disclosed and fixed within 72 hours.

### Maintenance

-Community code review.
-Bounty program for vulnerability reports.
-Ongoing compliance with Web3 security standards.

### Post-MVP

-Configurable logging.
-Optional SSO/2FA if/when user auth is added.
