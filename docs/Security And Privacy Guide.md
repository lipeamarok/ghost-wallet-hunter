# Ghost Wallet Hunter - Security and Privacy Guide

## 1. Core Principles

* **On-chain data is public:** All processing is exclusively performed on publicly available data from the Solana blockchain.
* **Zero personal data collection:** No names, emails, IP addresses, or any user-identifiable data are collected.
* **Stateless architecture:** No sensitive data is stored on servers, except for anonymized analysis logs used for metrics and debugging.

## 2. Technical Security

* **Encrypted communication:** All frontend-backend traffic is secured via HTTPS.
* **Environment isolation:** Production and testing are deployed in isolated environments.
* **Scoped access:** The backend only accesses APIs necessary for transaction analysis.

## 3. User Privacy

* **Address-level analysis only:** No correlation between wallet addresses and real-world identities.
* **Anonymization:** Usage logs and analytics are anonymized and aggregated.
* **Implicit consent:** By using the service, users agree to the analysis of public blockchain data. A simplified privacy policy is shown in the interface.

## 4. AI and Data Security

* **Access control:** API keys (e.g., OpenAI) are secured via secrets management environments.
* **Prompt auditing:** Prompts and responses are reviewed to prevent data leaks or bias.
* **Rate limiting:** Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks by limiting simultaneous queries.

## 5. Ethical Responsibility

* **Automatic disclaimers:** All AI responses include warnings about their probabilistic nature.
* **No accusations or judgments:** Language is neutral and educational, never defamatory.
* **Right to be forgotten:** If future versions store reports, users will have the option to delete their own data.

## 6. Mitigation Plans

* **Periodic audits:** Open-source code is available for ongoing community review.
* **Bug bounty:** Community incentivized to report security vulnerabilities.
* **Compliance:** Ongoing adherence to Web3 security best practices and regulations (e.g., GDPR, LGPD).

## 7. Incident Communication

* **Dedicated channel:** Status page and fast contact methods available for reporting bugs or incidents.
* **Rapid response:** Critical incidents will be publicly disclosed and patched within 72 hours.

## 8. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

* Configurable log granularity (enterprise-focused)
* Optional SSO/2FA if user authentication is introduced
