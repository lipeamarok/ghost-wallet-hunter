# Ghost Wallet Hunter - UX Design Guide

## 1. Core Principles

Maximum simplicity: Clean interface with no visual clutter, focusing on core content

Visual consistency: Harmonious color palette, elegant typography, and uniform spacing

Instant feedback: Clear status indicators on all buttons and actions (loading, success, error)

Accessibility: High-contrast colors and fonts, keyboard navigation, and legible text

Performance: Fast loading times, smooth animations, and zero lag

Advanced Accessibility Strategies

Detailed alt-text for all essential icons and graphics

Full keyboard and screen reader compatibility (ARIA labels in React)

Regular testing with Lighthouse and axe-core for barrier detection

High contrast mode: Quick-toggle option on the site

## 2. Recommended Structure (Pages & Components)

Page 1: Landing / Input

Large central input field for wallet address or transaction ID

Prominent, clear "Analyze" button

Short intro text explaining the purpose

Example wallet pre-filled for testing

Footer with useful links (docs, GitHub, disclaimer)

Page 2: Results & Dashboard

Interactive graph (React Flow):

Highlighted central node

Connected nodes colored by risk level

Tooltips on hover explaining each node

Sidebar or modal with AI-generated explanation:

Clear, empathetic, educational language

PDF report generation/download button

Action buttons to re-analyze or return

Animated loading indicator during processing

## 3. Visual Design

Color palette: Subtle tones with 2â€“3 core colors (e.g., navy blue, green, red for risks)

Typography: Modern fonts like Inter or Poppins with clear hierarchy

Icons & illustrations: Custom SVGs for buttons, loading, and indicators

Spacing & grid: Consistent layout and responsive alignment using TailwindCSS

Smooth animations: Button hover states, graph entry transitions

## 4. User Experience

Guided input: Clear placeholder and error messages (e.g., "Enter a valid Solana address")

Immediate response: Visual feedback on click (progress bar or spinner)

Intuitive interactivity: Clickable graph elements for more context

Mobile-friendly: Responsive design with breakpoints for phones/tablets

Performance: Optimized assets and smooth rendering

## 5. UX Tools & Technologies

React.js for modular, reactive UI

TailwindCSS for consistent styling

React Flow for interactive graphs

Framer Motion for animations

ESLint + Prettier for code quality

Storybook (optional) for isolated component testing

JuliaOS Dashboard for prototyping integration

## 6. UX Quality Workflow

Wireframes and prototypes in Figma (Example Prototype)

User feedback sessions and revisions

Incremental development with component validation

Usability testing (including A/B tests)

Performance optimization (bundle minimization, lazy loading)

## 7. User Journeys

Happy Path (Ideal Flow):

User lands on homepage â†’ enters valid address â†’ clicks "Analyze" â†’ sees loading state â†’ dashboard loads with graph and explanation â†’ clicks node for details â†’ downloads report

Error Path:

User enters invalid address â†’ receives immediate error message â†’ corrects input â†’ proceeds
No connections found â†’ neutral message stating no suspicious activity
