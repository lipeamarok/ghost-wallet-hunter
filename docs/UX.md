# Ghost Wallet Hunter - Professional UX Design Guide

## 1. Core Design Philosophy

**Cybersecurity Aesthetic**: Clean, terminal-inspired interface with subtle matrix-style elements

**Professional Minimalism**: Zero visual clutter, monospace typography, technical precision

**Real-time Analysis Feedback**: Progressive disclosure showing investigation steps as they happen

**Accessibility First**: High-contrast terminal colors, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**Performance Priority**: Instant feedback, smooth transitions, zero lag

**Hacker-Style Progression**: Analysis unfolds like a real cybersecurity investigation

## 2. Visual Language

**Color Palette**:

- Background: Deep dark (#0a0a0a, #1a1a1a)
- Primary: Electric cyan (#00ffff)
- Success: Matrix green (#00ff41)
- Warning: Amber (#ffb000)
- Critical: Alert red (#ff3366)
- Text: Cool gray (#e0e0e0)

**Typography**:

- Primary: JetBrains Mono (monospace for technical feel)
- Secondary: Inter (for readability)
- Headers: Orbitron (futuristic, technical)

**Visual Elements**:

- Subtle scan lines animation
- Terminal cursor blinking
- Progressive text reveal (typewriter effect)
- Network graph with pulsing connections
- ASCII art status indicators

## 3. Investigation Flow UX

### **Phase 1: Input Interface

```tex
> ghost-wallet-hunter:~$ analyze [wallet_address]
  Initializing blockchain forensics toolkit...
  Loading detection algorithms...
  [█████████░] 90% Ready
```

### **Phase 2: Progressive Analysis Steps**

```text
[PHASE_0] Blacklist verification...........OK
[PHASE_1] Transaction pattern analysis....OK
[PHASE_2] Network topology mapping.......OK
[PHASE_3] Risk assessment calculation.....OK
[PHASE_4] Generating intelligence report..OK
```

### **Phase 3: Network Visualization**

- Start with single wallet node (zoom focus)
- Gradually reveal connections with smooth animations
- Branch out showing transaction paths
- Color-code connections by risk level
- Zoom out to show full network topology
- Interactive nodes with detailed metadata

### **Phase 4: Intelligence Report**

- Terminal-style progressive text reveal
- Technical analysis with detective reasoning
- Risk score with confidence intervals
- Actionable recommendations

## 3. Visual Design

Color palette: Subtle tones with 2â€“3 core colors (e.g., navy blue, green, red for risks)

Typography: Modern fonts like Inter or Poppins with clear hierarchy

Icons & illustrations: Custom SVGs for buttons, loading, and indicators

Spacing & grid: Consistent layout and responsive alignment using TailwindCSS

Smooth animations: Button hover states, graph entry transitions

## 4. User Experience

Guided input: Clear placeholder and error messages (e.g., "Enter a valid Solana address")

Immediate response: Visual feedback on click (progress bar or spinner)

Intuitive interactivity: Clickable graph elements for more context

Mobile-friendly: Responsive design with breakpoints for phones/tablets

Performance: Optimized assets and smooth rendering

## 5. UX Tools & Technologies

React.js for modular, reactive UI

TailwindCSS for consistent styling

React Flow for interactive graphs

Framer Motion for animations

ESLint + Prettier for code quality

Storybook (optional) for isolated component testing

JuliaOS Dashboard for prototyping integration

## 6. UX Quality Workflow

Wireframes and prototypes in Figma (Example Prototype)

User feedback sessions and revisions

Incremental development with component validation

Usability testing (including A/B tests)

Performance optimization (bundle minimization, lazy loading)

## 7. User Journeys

Happy Path (Ideal Flow):

User lands on homepage â†’ enters valid address â†’ clicks "Analyze" â†’ sees loading state â†’ dashboard loads with graph and explanation â†’ clicks node for details â†’ downloads report

Error Path:

User enters invalid address â†’ receives immediate error message â†’ corrects input â†’ proceeds
No connections found â†’ neutral message stating no suspicious activity
