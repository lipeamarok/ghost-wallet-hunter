"""
JuliaOS Python Wrapper

This package provides a Python client and utilities to interact with the
JuliaOS backend, enabling Python developers to leverage its advanced
agent-based, swarm intelligence, and blockchain capabilities.
"""

# Import key components to make them available when the package is imported.
# For example, if your main client class is JuliaOSClient in client.py:
# from .client import JuliaOSClient

# Define what gets imported when `from juliaos_wrapper import *` is used.
# It's generally good practice to be explicit.
# __all__ = ["JuliaOSClient"] # Add other core classes/functions as needed

# Package version
__version__ = "0.1.0"

# You can also include package-level initialization code here if necessary.
# print("JuliaOS Wrapper package initialized.") # Optional: for debugging or info
