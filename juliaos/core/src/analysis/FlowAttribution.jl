F5 Flow Attribution Module - Real Fund Flow Decomposition

Implements sophisticated flow attribution using min-cost flow algorithms
to decompose contaminated funds through the transaction graph.
Tracks how tainted funds flow from sources to sinks with precise attribution.

No mocks - real algorithm implementation following ghost wallet hunter golden rules.
