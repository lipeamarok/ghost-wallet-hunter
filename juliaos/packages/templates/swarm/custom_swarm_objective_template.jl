# packages/modules/swarm/custom_swarm_objective_template.jl
# Template for defining a custom objective function for swarm optimization in JuliaOS

"""
MyCustomObjectiveModule - A module for defining a custom objective function.

This template shows how to define an objective function that can be used by
the swarm intelligence algorithms in JuliaOS.
"""
module MyCustomObjectiveModule

# Import necessary components from JuliaOS.
# This might include SwarmBase for types like OptimizationProblem if you are also defining
# the problem here, or just core Julia types if only defining the function.
# using JuliaOS.Swarms # For SwarmBase.OptimizationProblem, Swarms.register_objective_function!

# --- Define the Custom Objective Function ---

"""
    my_custom_objective_function(position::Vector{Float64})::Float64

Calculates the fitness value for a given position (candidate solution).
The `position` is a vector of decision variables.
The function should return a single Float64 value representing the fitness.
Lower values are better if the problem is a minimization problem.
Higher values are better if the problem is a maximization problem.

# Arguments
- `position::Vector{Float64}`: A vector representing the candidate solution's parameters.

# Returns
- `Float64`: The calculated fitness value for the given position.
"""
function my_custom_objective_function(position::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Example: A simple sphere function (minimization, optimum is 0.0 at position [0,0,...,0])
    # Replace this with your actual complex objective logic.
    
    # Validate input dimensions if necessary (though the Swarm system usually handles this)
    # if length(position) != EXPECTED_DIMENSIONS
    #     @error "Invalid position vector length. Expected $(EXPECTED_DIMENSIONS), got $(length(position))."
    #     return Inf # Return a very bad fitness for minimization
    # end

    fitness = 0.0
    for x_i in position
        fitness += x_i^2  # Sum of squares
    end

    # You can add logging for debugging specific evaluations if needed:
    # @debug "Evaluated position $(position) -> fitness $(fitness)"

    return fitness
end

"""
    my_constrained_objective_function(position::Vector{Float64})::Float64

Example of an objective function that includes constraint handling.
Swarm algorithms in JuliaOS might handle constraints explicitly, or you might
incorporate penalty methods into your objective function.
"""
function my_constrained_objective_function(position::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Base fitness calculation (e.g., sphere function)
    base_fitness = sum(x_i^2 for x_i in position)

    # Example constraint: sum of elements must be less than or equal to 10
    constraint_violation_sum = sum(position) - 10.0
    
    penalty_factor = 1000.0 # Penalty multiplier for violations

    if constraint_violation_sum > 0
        # Apply penalty for violating the constraint
        # This is a simple penalty method. More sophisticated methods exist.
        penalty = penalty_factor * constraint_violation_sum^2 # Quadratic penalty
        penalized_fitness = base_fitness + penalty

        return penalized_fitness
    else
        # No violation, return base fitness
        return base_fitness
    end
end


# --- Registration (Conceptual) ---
# Objective functions need to be registered with the Swarms module to be usable by name
# when configuring a Swarm.

# Example conceptual registration (actual API may vary):
# function register_my_custom_objectives()
#     # Assuming JuliaOS.Swarms.register_objective_function! is the way to do it.
#     JuliaOS.Swarms.register_objective_function!(
#         "MySphereObjective",  # Unique name for this objective function
#         my_custom_objective_function
#     )
#
#     JuliaOS.Swarms.register_objective_function!(
#         "MyConstrainedSphereObjective",
#         my_constrained_objective_function
#     )
#     @info "Custom objective functions registered with JuliaOS Swarms."
# end

# Call this registration function from your main application setup,
# or JuliaOS might have a mechanism to auto-discover and register objectives
# from modules in a specific directory.
# register_my_custom_objectives()

@info "MyCustomObjectiveModule template loaded. Define and register your objective functions."

# --- Optional: Defining a complete OptimizationProblem ---
# You might also define a full OptimizationProblem here if it's tightly coupled
# with your objective function.

# function create_my_optimization_problem()::JuliaOS.Swarms.SwarmBase.OptimizationProblem
#     dimensions = 5
#     # Bounds: Vector of Tuples, e.g., [(-5.0, 5.0), (-5.0, 5.0), ...]
#     bounds = [(-10.0, 10.0) for _ in 1:dimensions]
#     objective_func_ref = my_custom_objective_function # Direct reference
